# waynav

Wayland replacement for keynav. Reads `~/.config/waynav/waynavrc`
(same syntax as keynavrc), shows a fullscreen grid overlay via
wlr-layer-shell, and controls the mouse via wlr-virtual-pointer.
Targets wlroots-compatible compositors (tested on niri).

waynav is a short-lived process. A compositor hotkey launches it;
it grabs the keyboard, draws a grid, interprets keypresses, and
exits when the user presses `end`. No daemon, no IPC, no state
between invocations. A flock on `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/waynav.lock`
prevents concurrent instances.

## Build & test

```
make          # build (runs meson setup on first call)
make test     # build + run unit tests
make int-test # run Docker-backed integration tests (host only)
make lint     # clang-tidy + scan-build + cppcheck in parallel
make clean    # wipe build dir
```

Compiler flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. Warnings are build
errors. `make lint` runs three static analysis tools in parallel;
each can also run alone (`make lint-tidy`, `make lint-scan`,
`make lint-cppcheck`).

## Architecture

Four subsystems with clean boundaries. The grid model and config
parser have zero Wayland dependencies and are tested in isolation.
The overlay owns all Wayland state and is exercised against real
compositors in integration tests.

### Region model (grid.c)

Pure geometry. A `region_state` holds the current rectangle, grid
subdivision parameters, a history stack, and drag state. All
`region_*` functions are deterministic — given the same inputs
they produce the same rectangle, with no side effects outside
the struct.

Cell numbering follows keynav's scheme: top-to-bottom within
each column, then left-to-right across columns. For a 4×4
grid, cell 1 is top-left, cell 4 is bottom-left of the first
column, and cell 5 is top of the second column. Getting this
wrong breaks all cell-select bindings.

### Config parser (config.c)

Reads waynavrc into a flat array of bindings. Each binding maps
a keysym+modifier pair to a chain of commands. One special case:
lines starting with `start` have their chained commands stored
separately as `start_commands` on the config struct, not as a
normal binding. These run once at startup to set the initial
grid.

Key names are resolved through xkbcommon's `xkb_keysym_from_name`,
so the config is written in symbolic names (like `semicolon` or
`Return`) rather than scancodes. A name identifies a key, not the
symbol that key currently produces: `config_resolve_keycodes` turns
each binding's keysym into the keycode that carries it once the
keymap is known, and matching compares keycodes. This is keynav's
model — `XStringToKeysym` then `XKeysymToKeycode` at config load —
and it is what makes `shift+h` work. Matching on the keysym xkb
reports instead cannot: with shift held that keysym is `H`, so the
binding never fires, and Caps Lock breaks the unshifted bindings
the same way.

Two consequences. Names that share a key are one binding after
resolution (`period` and `greater`, `8` and `asterisk`), and a
later line overrides an earlier one on the same key+modifiers, so
`config_find_binding` returns the last match rather than the first.
The keymap arrives from the compositor after the config is parsed,
which is why resolution is a separate pass and runs again on every
keymap event.

Command keyword dispatch goes through `match_keyword` in
config.c. It matches a keyword prefix and guards that the next
character is not alphabetic, so `click` does not silently match
`clicker`. Argument pointers are derived as
`str + strlen(keyword)`, never a hard-coded offset, so a keyword
rename cannot desynchronize the argument parse. Every command
form — simple, parameterized, and shell — routes through this
one helper; adding a bare `strncmp` check elsewhere reintroduces
the prefix-collision bug.

### Overlay (overlay.c)

Owns the Wayland connection and all protocol objects: layer
surface, keyboard, virtual pointer, SHM buffer pool, frame
callbacks, and key repeat timer. This is the largest file and
the one with the most moving parts.

The overlay creates a fullscreen transparent surface on the
Overlay layer with exclusive keyboard interactivity. Its input
region is set to empty (0×0) so mouse events pass through to
windows underneath — only the keyboard is captured.

The layer-shell output is intentionally left unset so the compositor
chooses it from the current focus policy. Treat `wl_surface.enter` as
the source of truth for which output the overlay landed on.

The virtual pointer is created with no output suggestion, and
`vptr_warp` sends `motion_absolute` in layout coordinates: the
overlay-local point plus the selected output's logical origin, over
the union of every output's logical geometry. The suggestion is only
a hint — sway maps the device to that output, river ignores it — so
output-local coordinates are right only where the hint is taken,
while layout coordinates with no suggestion are right everywhere,
because an unmapped pointer is always read against the whole layout.
Getting this wrong fails silently: on two side-by-side outputs every
warp doubles its x, and an overlay on the secondary output warps onto
the primary.

Rendering uses cairo into double-buffered wl_shm buffers.
Fractional scaling works by rendering at `buffer_size × scale`
and using `wp_viewport_set_destination` for the logical size.

The event loop polls two file descriptors: the Wayland
connection and a timerfd for key repeat. A key event carries the
keycode straight into `config_find_binding()`; only the modifier
state goes through xkbcommon, via `xkb_mods_to_config()`, which
translates it into the config's `MOD_*` bitmask. The keymap event
is where bindings get resolved to keycodes, and it can arrive
before `overlay_run` has set the config, so `overlay_run` resolves
them too.

### Input dispatch (input.c)

Bridges config and region. Takes a matched binding's command
chain and runs each command in sequence: region mutations, warp,
click, drag, shell exec. `end` must also release any active
drag before the overlay exits. After each chain it saves to
history (unless the chain contained `history-back`, to avoid
pushing the restored state right back) and requests a redraw.

Shell commands fork+exec through `/bin/sh -c` and are
fire-and-forget — no waitpid.

## Modifier translation

The config parser defines `MOD_SHIFT`, `MOD_CTRL`, `MOD_ALT`,
`MOD_SUPER` as a bitmask. The Wayland keyboard path receives
xkb modifier state. `xkb_mods_to_config()` in overlay.c
translates between them using `xkb_state_mod_name_is_active`
with `XKB_STATE_MODS_DEPRESSED`. If this translation is wrong
or incomplete, shifted/ctrl'd bindings silently stop matching
with no error.

## Wayland protocol stack

Four non-core protocols, all confirmed working on niri. Protocol
XML files live in `protocol/` and are processed by
wayland-scanner at build time.

- wlr-layer-shell — fullscreen overlay with keyboard grab.
- wlr-virtual-pointer — absolute pointer positioning, button
  press/release, axis scroll.
- wp-fractional-scale + wp-viewporter — correct rendering at
  non-integer scales (e.g. 1.5×).
- xdg-output — logical output geometry.

## Linting

`misc-include-cleaner` is disabled in `.clang-tidy` because
Wayland's generated umbrella header (`wayland-client.h`)
provides all `wl_*` types through inline code, and the checker
can't trace through it — it produces dozens of false positives
per file asking for headers that don't exist.

## Logging

All output goes to stderr through `log.h`. Four levels: error,
warn, info, debug. Use `log_err`/`log_warn`/`log_info`/
`log_debug` everywhere — no raw fprintf. `log_debug` is gated
by a threshold check before the format call, so it costs nothing
when disabled. Keep info-level sparse: startup, activation, exit.

## Writing style

Wrap prose at 80 columns. Code can exceed 80 when breaking
would hurt readability.

## Tests

Unit tests use plain `assert()` and live in `tests/`. Each test
binary is standalone, registered with meson's test runner.
Grid, config, and input dispatch are tested in isolation; the
overlay is verified manually on a live compositor.

### Integration tests

`make int-test` (or `./int/run_tests`) runs the Docker-backed
harness under `int/`. It builds compositor images (Sway, niri),
starts containers, and drives waynav through a real compositor
via the smoke scripts in `int/lib/`. It needs Docker and a Linux
host — it is not part of `make test` and does not run in CI. The
harness uses the `test-runner.bash`/`tests.sh` stack vendored
under `vendor/github.com/reconquest/`.

Make failure assertions explicit: call `tests:eval false` before
`tests:assert-success` rather than relying on `tests:eval` state
left over from a prior loop iteration. Helpers shared across the
smoke scripts (`:cleanup-process`, `:cleanup-all`) must keep
matching signatures.

## Workflow

Keep diffs minimal and update tests and the README in the same
session as behavior changes.
